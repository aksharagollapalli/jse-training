3.toString
5.wait(2 methods)
6.notify(3 methods)
7.getClass

what is the use of hashCode and equals:
-------------------------------------
1.To avoid the duplicate data in the object for that you need to override the hash code and equals method in your pojo class
POJO-->Plain old java object

A class which is not extend or implements any other class that class we can call it as pojo class.

In C language you have pass by value and pass by reference

but in java we don't have pass by reference we have only pass by value
